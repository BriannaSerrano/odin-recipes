  <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p>Type of tortilla prepared with corn, milk or water, sugar and salt, similar to a pancake. It has a sweet taste</p>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>450 grams of corn kernels (can be frozen or canned)</li>
    <li>½ cup of milk</li>
    <li>2 whole eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon wheat flour (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of corn flour</li>
    <li>1 spoon of sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>salt to your taste</li>
    <li>Sliced ​​mozzarella cheese to fill the cachapas (since where we live we don't find “e'mano cheese”)</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a frying pan, put a teaspoon of butter the size of a walnut. This amount is enough to make a cachapa.</li>
      <li>Wait for the butter to sizzle a little and add a ladleful of the cachapa dough. Let it cook over medium heat until you see that bubbles appear in the dough, or holes form, like in pancakes.</li>
      <li>When the bubbles described in the previous point are observed, turn the cachapa so that it cooks on the other side. Each cachapa is cooked for more or less 3 or 4 minutes on each side, depending on its size.</li>
      <li>To finish, place half a wheel of hand cheese (failing that, mozarella) on the cachapa and close it with the other half so that the cheese melts with the heat of the cachapa itself.</li>
      <li>Cachapas are served accompanied by coffee, juice or whatever drink you like the most, to accompany breakfast or a snack.</li>
    </ol>
