  <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p>Encebollado is a fish broth that contains albacore, cassava, tomato, red onion, cilantro, chili powder, cumin and other spices.</p>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Cups Red Onion, chopped into thin strips</li>
    <li>3 ripe kidney tomatoes, quartered</li>
    <li>1/2 Tablespoon Ground Cumin</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dry chili pepper</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Liter Water</li>
    <li>4 Tablespoons Finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>1 pound fresh albacore, sliced</li>
    <li>2 Cups Yucca cut into cubes</li>
    <li>2/3 Cup Red Pepper, chopped into large pieces</li>
    <li>2/3 Cup Green Pepper Chopped into large pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 Cup Celery, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>2 Maggi Vegetable Broth Cubes</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>4 Units Lemon cut into quarters</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the water in a pot to boil, add 2 tomatoes and half a chopped onion, add the celery, the pepper pieces, 2 tablespoons of cilantro, garlic, cumin, salt, pepper and dried chili.</li>
    <li>In another separate pot, cook the previously chopped cassava with plenty of water until it is soft.</li>
    <li>Separately, make the onion pickle with the rest of the finely chopped Paite√±a onion, washed, drained and seasoned with salt, lemon and the remaining chopped cilantro. Let it rest until it is cured</li>
    <li>Add the albacore loins to the broth from step 1, cook it completely and remove from the pot.</li>
    <li>After the cooked albacore has been reserved, remove the vegetables from the broth and place them in a blender, add a little cooked yucca and a little yuca cooking liquid. Sift the processed liquid over the broth and add the yuca cooking water. Dissolve the MAGGI Vegetable Broth cubes. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes over medium heat. We return the albacore to the preparation.</li>
    <li>Adjust the flavors with salt and pepper. Place some soup with pieces of yucca and albacore on the plate and serve accompanied with a little of the onion curtido that you prepared previously.</li>
  </ol>
