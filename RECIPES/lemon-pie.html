  <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p>is a lemon pie, usually served as a dessert, made with a shortcrust pastry crust, filled with lemon curd and a fluffy meringue on top</p>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>2 cups of flour (280 grams)</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 cup of condensed milk (240 grams)</li>
    <li>125 grams of butter</li>
    <li>1 cup of sugar (200 grams)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of flower sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The first thing you should do is prepare the base dough for the lemon pie. To do this, mix the flour with the baking powder, an egg, the butter and the powdered sugar. You should knead until you obtain a smooth and soft dough.</li>
    <li>When you have it, line the entire mold with the dough and bake it for 10 minutes at 170ºC. When it's ready, remove it and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Now it is the turn of the lemon pie filling. Mix the lemon juice with the condensed milk until forming a smooth cream. Pour this cream over the dough you baked in the previous step and reserve the cake.</li>
    <li>Now that you have the filling, all that's left is the meringue for the topping. To do this, separate the whites from the yolks of the three remaining eggs and beat the whites until stiff. When they are almost ready, add the sugar little by little while continuing to beat.</li>
    <li>With the help of a pastry bag, distribute the meringue in the shape of peaks. If you don't have a sleeve, simply take a spatula and spread it all over the top of the lemon pie. Now, bake the cake for a few minutes so that the meringue hardens slightly and turns golden brown.</li>
    <li>When it is ready, remove it, let it cool in the refrigerator and you can now serve the lemon and meringue pie.</li>
  </ul>
